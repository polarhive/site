        <blockquote>
            <i> “Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” ― Edward Snowden</i>

        <blockquote>
            <i>
                “A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a
                building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders,
                give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a
                computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.” ― Robert
                Heinlein, Time Enough for Love
            </i>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <i>
                ”A hacker is someone who enjoys playful cleverness—not necessarily with computers. The
                programmers in the old MIT free software community of the 60s and 70s referred to themselves as
                hackers. Around 1980, journalists who discovered the hacker community mistakenly took the term to mean
                “security breaker.” ― Richard M. Stallman
            </i>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote> <i> ”The important thing we hope you understand is that money won’t get you in to MIT, and
                money
                shouldn’t keep you out. Our goal is to admit and enroll the best students from around the world
                regardless of their financial circumstances, and make sure they can afford MIT while they’re
                here.” ―
