# A dilemma ~ privacy? or instant connectivity --- you can't have both

There's the obvious privacy issue, the cellular radio in the phone is screaming
all day to towers near you to keep you connected 24/7 wherever you go.

I have the phone-app **disabled** on my [phone](/blog/digital-minimalism-on-my-phone-foss). I have
Airplane mode turned on. I only rely on WiFi to connect to the internet. When using a SIM,
there's no guarantee that calls and SMSs are not intercepted. These calls aren't encrypted.
SIM cards --- can be easily cloned by people impersonating you. Plus, you have to trust ISPs (*Jio/FB*)
that they don't sell out or share data with anyone.

## I use my phone more like a [portable computer](/blog/phones-make-me-counter-productive/)

What I mean by normal calls is heading to your phone app, dialing a number and
hitting the call button. No I don't do that. Don't get me wrong I love
technology and use my phone & laptop to do VoIP calls and texts everyday, I
don't like phone numbers and the vendor lock-in. Numbers are like fingerprints.
For example, I can host my email for cheap, control, encrypt emails, delete it
when I want, forward emails to a new one but I can never host my own phone
number unless I'm a millionaire and buy my own island.

Before you think of it, I **DO NOT** use proprietary apps like: Instagram,
Discord, WhatsApp [Facebook](/fb/) or any app that needs a real, static, phone
number to login to new devices.

## 1. Call connection issues

There are too many carriers around the world and **things can go wrong due to
their errors**, you or your friend can get connected **to a stranger**, they
could listen in and you never know. VoIP calls are standardized between the 2
parties in the call.

Once you dial the number the call goes **O**ver **T**he **A**ir through your
phone's or laptop's cellular or WiFi network connects to the ISP's exchange
does its magic and connects you to the recipient.

## 2. Crystal Clear

Calls over data are much better in quality, anyone who has tried VoIP calls
knows this and compression protocols get better and better. P2P reveals your IP
address at the cost of slightly better audio quality so enable a server proxy.

## 3. Future Proof

I can pickup a call from any of my logged in devices. The only thing to update
on your end is the 'client' - the app you use. The server stuff is done quite
easily, often no need for physical work on the medium such as phone lines or
underground cables when compared to normal calls over landlines or setting up
towers for the next generation of smartphone hardware.

## 4. International calling and overseas charges

Get over it, these calls will always be overpriced compared to data, it was
designed before the internet was mainstream. ISPs overcharge when data prices
are much cheaper.

## 5. Meta Data

### A normal call's meta-data contaminates a **minimum** of 5 places

1. Caller's phone
2. Call-ee's phone
3. Both ISPs and the gov.
4. Sting rays and 3rd party snooping in either neighbourhoods.
5. Geolocation tracking / cell tower triangulation in either neighbourhood.

### At the most you can protect the other 2 ends but the ISP or carrier is the middle man. They can redirect your calls or record them

**Most phones have malicious apps** which send your phone number and call
details, with other info such as birthdays, nick names without your consent.
Examples of such data mining apps are - proprietary apps like **Truecaller,
Facebook, Google Contacts, TikTok, MIUI.** This is sold to advertisers without
your consent - and these advertisers make profiles with data points about you,
send you targeted ads based off your social graph and your interaction with
your friends.

# My current setup

I use **[Telegram FOSS](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.telegram.messenger/)** and
**[Element](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/)** [matrix] both are
from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) and as for the laptop I use their respective desktop-apps.
Read about my review on various [messaging](/blog/messengers) apps.

**[Telegram](https://desktop.telegram.org)** and **[Element](https://app.element.io/)** are
cross device, have opensource clients, free, sign up via username / VoIP numbers
and then you can ditch the VoIP number. They have settings for phone-number privacy,
feature encrypted chats, usernames, and allow you to place cross-device voice & video
calls. (Telegram and Signal). Element is federated and can be future-proofed. Signal
and Telegram can't run independently.

### Online VoIP apps

TextNow, Google Voice, a friend's landline number can be used to sign up for
Signal or Telegram. You can get the login codes on previous sessions on
Telegram, remember to set a 2fa passcode. Then hide your phone discover-ability
and keep at least 2 sessions active, one on your PC and another on your phone.
You don't need to be connected always, it works independently on the device.
**If you used Signal your number is exposed so unless the fix use it with a
VoIP number.**

**NOTE**: Do not send texts or call any of my old numbers, the number gets
recycled or deleted. If you have any number - I do not consent to saving it to
your contacts anymore, please purge it from your contacts and delete my contact
from Google / Amazon / TikTok / Facebook's servers.

If you try calling my old number don't be surprised if it says it's switched
off.
