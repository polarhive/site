title: Cold Turkey 2021

## 2021 is the year I complete my general-schooling, plan ahead, catch-up on my backlogs

### **Because 2020 has taught us that** anything **can happen at times when we are the least prepared**

Covid was the highlight of the year, but let's hope for the better. **I’m sure we have
all heard-of** ‘New Year resolutions’ --- this post about that, but I am writing
this two weeks before new-years, I plan to dive head first, cold-turkey, whatever you
want to call it, taking on' 2021 with a fresh-mind.

It starts today --- the 18th of December, right-now, I just took a cold shower;
after hitting `git push` for this quick blog-post. If you plan something right now and leave
yourself in that ‘negotiation room of your mind’ then by the next time
we meet nothing’s going to happen and we all continue-on with our
lives as we love to surf against our *cognitive friction*.

> ## I hope your conscience reminds you of that negotiation deal with your brain
> Where you say --- **“I’ll do that project tomorrow, I’ll start tomorrow, I
> don’t have time. Procrastination. Or as I like to call it ~ ‘working on getting
> work done”**

## **The point is: you start it in the next 10 seconds before your** negotiating mind tries to find an excuse

Go drink a glass of water, have a cold shower or if you're reading this at
night and you're just about to doze off --- try sleeping without a pillow and feel
that weird 'feeling of falling' your idea doesn't have to be ambitious.

## I plan to:

- learn Python & C++
- teach / educate about privacy, GNU/Linux, static websites --- in a fun way on [Peertube](/peertube) and [LBRY](/lbry)
- setup a casual [Matrix chatroom](/chatroom/matrix)
- fix my wardrobe & only buy clothes that I care about wearing
- take 1 photo a week for the year and compile it into a video
- focus on minimalism, and towards an offline first world [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) / [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/philosophy.html)
- teach [diesel](https://pixelfed.social/p/polarhive/170839994435506176) new tricks
- create a bucketlist template for a helpful collaborative project I have in mind
- create a codeberg repo for various concept ideas: originally they were shower thoughts
- setup a [PGP](/pgp/) key and learn that stuff
- learn to edit using kdenlive
- make memes on reddit
- These are not all my goals in my head, but some for starters.

> ## You **define the rules and** you **stick to them**

Discipline your mind and then you can always complete tasks you throw at it
because you build up a pattern. Go tell your goals to someone, post it on your
social media feeds to be accountable for it --- write it to yourself on a piece of
paper (like me) and put it somewhere for example your school blazer, or write a
blog post but.

### **The most important thing is**: read it again on December 1st 2021

And you'll see how you treated yourself. These words today --- will only truly reflect when I read this in 2021 in this
[follow-up article](/blog/2022). Till then ~adieu
