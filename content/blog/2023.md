## *Here's a rant about---life, exams, FOSS stuff & the tangled mess that my uni courses have become*

For the past four months or so --- I've been juggling [university](/blog/college) 
coursework, restarting social-media (ahem Instagram); attending hackathons and
meeting new people at college. I have not really managed my time well. I wanted
to re-start my YouTube channel, manage my time better and was seeking to be more 
independent. I have really become self-aware of the choices I have borne.

### So here's my 2023 in [review!](/egg "in reverse chronological order")

![](tree.jpg)

> ### *It was a bit chaotic, to say the least. Let me [walk](/photos "cheesy pun") you through*

I have an itch to put to use, the stuff I am learning via the courses taught at
college. For example: in **December** as a part of our Python course a we made
a mini-project---a small typing-speed test, ***Ã  la** *monkeytype** but written
in Python.

But this wasn't driven by passion or solved a real world problem, it was just
coursework. But hey it's something that will stick around for some time,
you feel happy working on it, rather than---memorizing all your Jacobian
recurrance-relations, Quantum Mechanics derivations or the parts of a lathe
machine without ever seeing or using one in real life `~T_T~`

### I gave my first-talk at college `</HSP>` 

![talk](/blog/jukebox/back.jpg)

The HSP [Project Expo](/blog/jukebox) was pretty interesting, met many new
people & awkwardly--it served as a good conversation starter. A handful of
people after the event got over reached out to me, when I got back to
hostel---I showcased a small demo. (the cursed WiFi didn't help at all tho!!) 

![wifi](wifi.jpg) 

So we talked about our past projects and other cool tech-stuff.

### Shoutouts!

Speaking of which, I really need to showcase a bunch of people who've inspired
me and bounce ideas back and forth. I am really greatful for the people I have
met in college and some in school back in January 23' This probably needs a
post of its own but do check their projects / websites out!

And yes, these are all first years!

![](class2.jpg)

I've been swayed by the people I surround myself with (both in good and bad
ways;) I have broken some of the constraints that I had set 3-4 years ago. i.e:
I deleted almost all my *[centralized](/blog/fedi-first)* social-media accounts.

But, I started using Instagram again, later in **November** ðŸ¤¦ that decision
for one, has spiraled and now turned into a time sink. Nikhil has a good
[post](https://heftymouse.me/blog/instagram/) that I reason with. I don't think
I went *overboard*; but I'm not proud that I clock an average of 5hrs of
screentime doom-scrolling reels every week. Don't worry, I still am on the
fediverse and will probably delete Instagram unless I'm posting a story.

## Hackathons

![](gdsc.jpg)

I took part in 2 overnight hackathons this year: pictured above is GDSC's
Override. Second was Hacknight 5.0 --- celeberating Hacktoberfest yes, the Digital
Ocean one! You get to solve issues on some open-source projects and earn bounty
points as close issues assigned on a git repo.

![](flash.jpg)

I met a lot of wonderful people, I remember having a bad sore throat for the
entire next week. But it was worth it!

![](duck.jpg)
> ### *a new-core memory*

Also, these cute squeeky duckies from override---which we mortally destroyed
tossing it around, playing badminton in the quadrangle the next day ðŸ’€ 

![](seniors.jpg)

It was really fun staying up all night, playing TT, lounging on beanbags,
playing carrom, craving mid-night snacks on campus and sipping black coffee (I
owe you one Rithul!). And vibing with seniors dancing to Bohemian Raphsody. (I
really need to find that video!!)

### [Harsh](https://munsocecc.vercel.app/members "cool senior btw") droppin' them beats

![](harsh.jpg)

It was in **October**, after my first sem-exams, when I realized --- most of
first-year courses to me, is pretty boring. There, I said it! (*sans the
free-time* you get). It is mostly a repeat of 11th and 12th grade and you are
just made to memorize a bunch of theorems, recycle it, and write on paper. Make
sure you forget it after the end-sem exam, because you still have another chem
cycle semester ahead of you!

### ISFCR_{C@pTUr3tH3Fl@G}

**September 2nd**: This was officially, the first [event](https://github.com/Mitul-Joby/PESUEC-CTF23-Official-Writeups/) I took
part in this year! I placed 6th out of 200 or so teams which took part that
day. I even got a smol cash prize

![](ctf.jpg)

P.S. Notice the typo in the IP address octant! (01)

> *Before you ask me, I am not in the photo because only the top 3 teams get a photo with the hugeass cheque anol :/*

### I feel I am buried under a mountain of unfinished tasks

![](class1.jpg)

Most of what I have built this year were projects I had pursued before I joined
college in **August**: Perhaps engineering courses were always meant to be this
way; I shouldn't be expecting any sort of drastic change from my school days.
This is a deadweight I just need to get over with!

#### polarhive.net/git

These are tools I've been building that I wanted to use myself and solved
real-problems. I feel I have not built enough, or the commits I made were
trivial. Let me know if you have some ideas that I can help build / solve.

- [jukebox](/blog/jukebox): play LastFM music recommendations using: mpd, yt-dlp and bash without opening a browser
- [arceo](/arceo): a blocklist against consumerism
- [pasta](/pasta): a pastebin written in go
- [vulpes](/vulpes): minimal firefox userjs
- [lava](/lava): this site's hugo theme
- [Ammachi's Kathas](/ammachiskathas) a collection of malayalam short-stories (audiobook)

![](cott.jpg)

Met some of my highschool teachers too, I'm still surpirsed they remember us, and
it was lunch time so we couldn't miss Babu uncle's kebab, *felt like 2018*

![](cafe.jpg)

*Shared a good icecream cornerhouse and called it a day!*

## The long road ahead

> As my dad would say --- "It's about finding the balance--and **understanding the
*process*** as early as possible"

I regret not taking heed; much earlier. I had a great year so far. I would need
a lot of pushing and I promise to the 10 or so people still reading my blog in
2024 I will post more updates here `>,..,<`

Just kidding: I've been hitting almost 3 GB in traffic this month, at least
that is what Netlify tells me so (I don't run analytics on this site). Thank
you for sticking around! *~adieu*
