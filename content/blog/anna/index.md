> Presented and written by Adhesh, Anirudh, Aditya and Nathan

Building personal blogs from the ground up can be a *tedious process*. Some of us
have had our hands deep in vanilla HTML and CSS, which isn't fun to maintain. We
all want to get to the point and share our thoughts on the web. But, there is a
small bump that stops us from doing so.

Maintaining your personal site is like working with your own Neovim
configuration. Every issue fixed would lead to an entirely unrelated bug. There
is a lot of time spent fixing things rather than getting productive work done.

A static site generator is an immensely useful application. It can simplify the
whole process: allowing you to spend time and energy on quality content.

There are several amazing SSGs out there, like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Building your own SSG is an amazing learning
experience. It also motivates one to maintain and improve their personal site.

## Introduction

ACM-PESU ECC conducts the ACM Industrial Experience Program (AIEP), an annual program that spans six weeks.

> It involves students working as a team to develop an industrial-level
> project. AIEP intends to give students hands-on experience with real-world
> projects. It is an excellent opportunity to interact with like-minded
> individuals.

Our AIEP team consisted of [Adhesh](https://github.com/DedLad), [Aditya](https://github.com/bwaklog), 
[Nathan](https://github.com/polarhive), and [Anirudh](https://github.com/anirudhsudhir).

Our mentors (cool ass senior names!) gave us some great ideas for a team of us
four freshers. We were puzzled whether to build a distributed Postgres clone or
a load balancer. Deep discussions over a week got us to the topic of making
blog sites and how tiring it is to work with, which only gets worse as you
write more and more content for your internet home.

This and inspirations from [Saaru](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee/saaru) and
[Sapling](https://github.com/NavinShrinivas/sapling) pushed us to tackle this
problem with our own SSG.

A static site generator in Go

```

## The small but big decision!

Anna is written in [Go](https://go.dev). We considered writing it in Rust, but
that came with a steep learning curve. Go is a powerful language and has
excellent concurrency support, which suited our requirements to build a
performant application. 

### What's in a name?

Probably the first thing that us four came across when joining ACM and HSP was
the famous Saaru repository. [Saaru](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee/saaru),
one of the projects that inspired our ssg, is derived from a [Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada) word. 
Saaru is a thin lentil soup, usually served with rice.

> In Kannada, rice is referred to as 'anna'( ಅನ್ನ) pronounced <i>/ɐnːɐ/</i>

This was just a playful stunt that we played. We plan on beating Saaru at
buildtimes, optimizing at runtime.

## Genesis

We began the project in a unique manner, with each of us creating our own
prototype of the SSG. This was done to familiarize everyone with the Go
toolchain.

The first version of the SSG did just three things. It rendered markdown
(stored in files in a content folder in the project directory) to HTML. This
HTML was injected into a layout.html file and served over a local web server.
Later, we implemented a front matter YAML parser to retrieve page metadata

---
## What made us develop this to a great extent?

- Beginner-friendly: An easy setup wizard, easy and ready to use layouts, and themes. We want the
process of typing out a blog and putting it up on your site to be short and
simple.
- Speed: Be fast (hugo – written in Go, is remarkably fast)
- Maintainable: This ssg will be used by us, hence it should be easy to fix
bugs and add new features
- Learning curve: None of us have really shipped a production ready
application. Since AIEP is all about making industry-ready projects, we chose
to use go: so we could spend more ***writing** code* and not worrying about our
toolchain or escaping dependency hell.
- Owning a piece of the internet: Aditya and Anirudh registered their own
domain names. Now their anna sites live on [hegde.live] and [sudhir.live]

---
## Benchmarks! Can anna lift??

In simple terms, to beat Saaru's render time (P.S. we did!). Something you
probably never notice while deploying, but it is what pushed us to spend hours
on this.

Adhesh was pretty excited to pick up Go and implement profiling, shaving
milliseconds off-of build times, when he implemented parallel rendering using
goroutines.

> - Switched to a two goroutine system
> - The main goroutine runs the application and renders pages
> - The second goroutine runs the local web server
> - Eliminated locks and restarting of application on file modification

After about 2 weeks of training (*ahem*) coding, we had a (merge) bringing
parallel rendering and profiling to the table

## A big rewrite (when we went for a TDD approach)

Starting off this project, we kept adding functionality without optimization.
We didn’t have a proper structure; PRs would keep breaking features and
overwriting other functions. We proceeded to restructure our SSG into:

> modules previously part of `cmd/anna/utils.go` and `cmd/anna/main.go` were to
> be split between `pkg/parsers/`, `pkg/engine/` and `pkg/helper`

```text
pkg
├─── helpers
│   ├─── helpers.go
│   └─── helper_test.go
├─── engine
│   ├─── anna_engine.go
│   ├─── anna_engine_test.go
│   ├─── engine.go
│   ├─── engine_test.go
│   ├─── user_engine.go

│   └─── engine_integration_test.go
└─── parsers
	├── parser.go
	├── parser_test.go
	└── parser_integration_test.go
```

### New proposed rendering system

- Currently there are two separate types of files that have to be rendered. One set includes user-defined files such as `index.md`, `docs.md` and various posts. These are specific to a user.
- The second set of files that are rendered include `tags.html`, `sub-tags.html` and `posts.html`
- Now, the generator/engine has a method to render "anna specific" pages and another method to render "user defined" pages which include all the user pages and posts

## Edit this:

- Refactored main.go to only handle flags
- Wrote unit and integration tests for the parser and engine package
- Split the rendering system to make parallelisation easier by switching to a three method system.
- Render "user defined" pages which include all markdown files and posts (This method has been parallelised)
- Render tags and tag-subpages separately, which could be parallelised in the future
- Wrote a benchmark for main.go that times the entire application

## To search or not to search? 🤔

We were wondering if we’d need a search function on our site since Google and
any other web-crawler index our site anyway. If we needed to implement it, we
had a constraint: we could not use an API. It had to be static and local to be
user-friendly. Aditya and Anirudh implemented a JSON index generator that uses
Deep Data Merge to index posts on our site. This is built at runtime and works 
without any lag or noticeable delay when searching across posts.

---
## JS integration as plugins

Aditya added a field to our frontmatter which lets you pick and add certain JS
based snippets to your site. This way, you get to add `highlight.js` support, analytics scripts 
and donation page widgets, that you can source from the static/scripts folder.

---
## Wizard

Nathan proceeded to work on a GUI; a web-based wizard that let's a new user
setup anna along with a couple of easter eggs along the way 🍚

The wizard lets a user pick a theme, enter your name, pick navbar elements, and
validates fields using regex checks so you don’t need to worry about relative
paths in baseURLs, canonical links, and sitemaps. After successfully completing
the setup, the wizard launches a live preview of your site in a new tab.

### Raw HTML

What if you'd want to add a contact form to your site? or embedd YouTube videos or iframes of your choosing?

Anna let's us do that! Although, the point of a static site generator is to
quickly get to writing and focusing on the content. You can still embedd js
elements and iframe as needed to showcase any interesting YouTube videos or 
to just rickroll people!

## Tags

You can tag posts by hand, at the start of each markdown file and you get a
nice sub-page on your site so readers can discover similar content or browser
by category.
