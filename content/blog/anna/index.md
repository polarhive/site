> ### *Presented and written by Adhesh, Anirudh, Aditya and Nathan*

There are several amazing SSGs out there, like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Building your own SSG is an amazing learning
experience. It also motivates one to maintain and improve their personal site.

Building personal blogs from the ground up can be a *tedious process*. Some of
us have had our hands deep in vanilla HTML and CSS, which isn't fun to
maintain. We all want to get to the point and share our thoughts on the web.
But, there is a small bump that stops us from doing so.

Maintaining your personal site is like working with your own Neovim
configuration. Every issue fixed would lead to an entirely unrelated bug. There
is a lot of time spent fixing things rather than getting productive work done.

It can simplify the whole process: allowing you to spend time and energy on
quality content. Keep reading to find out how we designed anna `v1.0.0`

## Introduction

ACM-PESU ECC conducts the ACM Industrial Experience Program (AIEP), an annual
program that spans six weeks.

> *It involves students working as a team to develop an industrial-level
> project. AIEP intends to give students hands-on experience with real-world
> projects. It is an excellent opportunity to interact with like-minded
> individuals.*

Our AIEP team consisted of [Adhesh](https://github.com/DedLad),
[Aditya](https://github.com/bwaklog), [Nathan](https://github.com/polarhive),
and [Anirudh](https://github.com/anirudhsudhir).

Our mentors (cool ass senior names!) gave us some great ideas for a team of us
four freshers. We were puzzled whether to build a distributed Postgres clone or
a load balancer.

Deep discussions over a week got us to the topic of making blog sites and how
tiring it is to work with, which only gets worse as you write more and more
content for your internet home.

This and inspirations from [Saaru](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee/saaru) and
[Sapling](https://github.com/NavinShrinivas/sapling) pushed us to tackle this
problem with our own SSG.

A static site generator in Go
```

## The small but big decision!

Anna is written in [Go](https://go.dev). We considered writing it in Rust, but
that came with a steep learning curve. Go is a powerful language and has
excellent concurrency support, which suited our requirements to build a
performant application.

### What's in a name?

Probably the first thing that us four came across when joining ACM and HSP was
the famous Saaru repository. [Saaru](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee/saaru),
one of the projects that inspired our ssg, is derived from a
[Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada) word. Saaru is a thin lentil
soup, usually served with rice.

> In Kannada, rice is referred to as 'anna'(ಅನ್ನ) pronounced <i>/ɐnːɐ/</i>

This was just a playful stunt that we played. We plan on beating Saaru at build
times, optimizing at runtime and making the best of go-internals.

---
## Genesis

We began the project in a unique manner, with each of us creating our own
prototype of the SSG. This was done to familiarize everyone with the Go
toolchain.

The first version of the SSG did just three things. It rendered markdown
(stored in files in a content folder in the project directory) to HTML. This
HTML was injected into a layout.html file and served over a local web server.
Later, we implemented a front matter YAML parser to retrieve page metadata

---
## What made us develop this to a great extent?

- Beginner-friendly: An easy setup wizard, easy and ready to use layouts, and
themes. We want the process of typing out a blog and putting it up on your site
to be short and simple.
- Speed: Be fast (hugo – written in Go, is remarkably fast)
- Maintainable: This ssg will be used by us, hence it should be easy to fix
bugs and add new features
- Learning curve: None of us have really shipped a production ready
application. Since AIEP is all about making industry-ready projects, we chose
to use go: so we could spend more ***writing** code* and not worrying about our
toolchain or escaping dependency hell.
- Owning a piece of the internet: Aditya and Anirudh registered their own
domain names. Now their anna sites live on [hegde.live] and [sudhir.live]

---

## Benchmarks! Can anna lift??

In simple terms, to beat Saaru's render time (P.S. we did!). Something you
probably never notice while deploying, but it is what pushed us to spend hours
on this.

Adhesh was pretty excited to pick up Go and implement profiling, shaving
milliseconds off-of build times, when he implemented parallel rendering using
goroutines.

## Prototype

The initial prototype built by Adhesh consisted of a multi-goroutine system. A
new goroutine would be spawned to walk the required directories. If the current
path being walked was a file, the path would be passed to another function
along with its current modification time.

The previous mod time of the file would then be retrieved from a map holding
the mod times of all the files:

- If the given file was freshly created, its modification time would be added to the map.
- If there was no change in the mod time, no changes would be made.
- If there was a change between the current and previous mod times, another function would be called.

The new function checks if a child process is running:

- For the first render, when a process has not been created, a new process is created that runs anna ("go run main.go --serve")
- For successive renders, the existing process is killed and a new process is spawned once again that runs anna. 

This prototype was not very efficient as it created and killed processes for
every change. It had multiple goroutines attempting to walk the directories at
the same time. It also used multiple mutual exclusion locks to prevent data
races. Integrating this into the project also proved to be challenging.

## Improved version

The live reload feature was improved by Anirudh. The updated version utilised
two goroutines.

The main goroutine used the earlier file walker, with one important change: it
sequentially traversed the directory without spawning new goroutines. For any
modification to a file in the current traversal, a vanilla render of the entire
site would be performed. The goroutine would then sleep for a specified
duration (currently 1 second) before attempting the next directory traversal.

The secondary goroutine ran a local web server that served the `rendered/`
directory. This eliminated all locks and avoided the creation and destruction
of any child processes.

## We cook! 🍳

Here are some screenshots out of our group chats, that demonstrate build times,
profiling et-al when having thousands of markdown files or in this case just
copy-pasting a single markdown file en-mass!

> After about 2 weeks of training (*ahem*) coding, we had a (merge) bringing parallel rendering and profiling to the table

### Profiling

Heres the CPU profile of anna, generated using `pprof`. This profile was
generated while rendering this site.

Here's an SVG showing how much time each sys-call / process takes and how each
block adds-up to render / build times

You may wanna open in a new tab or zoom-in about 3-4x times to get to see how
our ssg works

## A big rewrite (when we went for a TDD approach)

Starting off this project, we kept adding functionality without optimization.
We didn’t have a proper structure; PRs would keep breaking features and
overwriting functions written by fellow team-mates.

### A new proposed rendering system

We proceeded to restructure our SSG into: modules previously part of
`cmd/anna/utils.go` and `cmd/anna/main.go` were to be split between
`pkg/parsers/`, `pkg/engine/` and `pkg/helper`

```text
pkg
├─── helpers
│   ├─── helpers.go
│   └─── helper_test.go
├─── engine
│   ├─── anna_engine.go
│   ├─── anna_engine_test.go
│   ├─── engine.go
│   ├─── engine_test.go
│   ├─── user_engine.go
│   ├─── user_engine_test.go
│   └─── engine_integration_test.go
└─── parsers
	├── parser.go
	├── parser_test.go
	└── parser_integration_test.go
```
Currently there are two separate types of files that have to be rendered. One
set includes user-defined files such as `index.md`, `docs.md` and various
posts. These are specific to a user.

The second set of files that are rendered include `tags.html`, `sub-tags.html`
and `posts.html` Now, the generator/engine has a method to render "anna
specific" pages and another method to render "user defined" pages which include
all the user pages and posts

Here's some of Anirudh's work written during week-2

> - Refactored main.go to only handle flags
> - Wrote unit and integration tests for the parser and engine package
> - Split the rendering system to make parallelisation easier by switching to a three method system.
> - Render "user defined" pages which include all markdown files and posts (This method has been parallelised)
> - Render tags and tag-sub pages separately, which could be parallelised in the future
> - Wrote a benchmark for main.go that times the entire application

## To search or not to search? 🤔

> That is the question? is our *static site* becoming dynamic! And at what
> cost?

We were wondering if we’d need a search function on our site since Google and
any other web-crawler index our site anyway. If we needed to implement it, we
had a constraint: we cannot use an API. It had to be static and local to be
user-friendly to work with. Aditya and Anirudh implemented a JSON index
generator that uses "Deep Data Merge" to index posts on our site.

This index is built at runtime and works without any lag or noticeable delay
when searching across posts. We mean to re-write it using WASM if necessary and
if it costs us time when performing searches.

![Demonstration of the search feature in anna](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acmpesuecc/anna/main/site/static/images/posts/fireside-anna/search.gif)

## JS integration as plugins

Aditya added a field to our frontmatter which lets you pick and add certain JS
based snippets to your site. This way, you get to add `highlight.js` support,
analytics scripts and donation page widgets; that you can source from the
`static/scripts` folder and toggle as needed per-markdown page.

## Wizard

Nathan proceeded to work on a GUI; a web-based wizard that let's a new user
setup anna along with a couple of easter eggs along the way 🍚

The wizard lets a user pick a theme, enter your name, pick navbar elements, and
validates fields using regex checks so you don’t need to worry about relative
paths in baseURLs, canonical links, and sitemaps. After successfully completing
the setup, the wizard launches a live preview of your site in a new tab.

![Demonstration of the GUI wizard in anna](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acmpesuecc/anna/main/site/static/images/posts/fireside-anna/wizard.gif)

### Raw HTML

What if you'd want to add a contact form to your site? or embed YouTube videos
or iframes of your choosing?

Anna let's us do that! Although, the point of a static site generator is to
quickly get to writing and focusing on the content. You can still embed js
elements and iframe as needed to showcase any interesting YouTube videos or to
just rickroll people!

## Tags

You can tag posts by hand, at the start of each markdown file and you get a
nice sub-page on your site so readers can discover similar content or browser
by category.
