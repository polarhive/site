## Remember 2021? or Should I say 2020?

I guess nothing much has changed in the world. The world battles the
pandemic. Although people aren't panicking this year compared to [last-year](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/covid-19-heres-why-people-are-hoarding-toilet-paper/the-reason-behind-the-hoarding/slideshow/74653774.cms).
Our dependence on proprietary software still disgusts me. Thanks to TikTok:
our average attention-spans have [reduced](https://muckrack.com/blog/2020/07/14/how-declining-attention-spans-impact-your-social-media).
I for one, made better use of my time in 2021 than in 2020.

## Remember that blog post I penned [a year ago](/blog/2021)?

## Time to reflect

I'm pretty satisfied with the goals I challenged myself with in that
post. Although, I didn't invest enough time to learn ``Python`` I
dabbled around with ``bash`` (shell scripting), ``Rust`` & ``C++``
instead. I started some working on my personal wiki: *aka* a
*digital-garden*. I dump interesting stuff I find on the internet.

## Here's the list of things

- learn Python & C++ -> partly done
- teach / educate about privacy, GNU/Linux, static websites - in a fun way on Peertube & LBRY -> done, taking a [break until 2023](/blog/big-break).
- setup a casual [Matrix chatroom](/chatroom/matrix) -> done
- fix my wardrobe; only buy clothes that I care about wearing -> I didn't buy any ['new-clothes'](/blog/minimalism/#clothing) this year
- take 1 photo a week for the year & compile it into a video -> Sorry, I can't find the photos after September sorry ü§î
- focus on minimalism, an offline first world youtube-dl, 100rabbits -> done done done, I [completely switched to RSS feeds](/blog/you-are-what-you-eat/)!  & stopped [using my phone](/blog/phones-make-me-counter-productive/)
- teach diesel some new tricks -> he learnt how to turn around 180 degrees & [roll over](/blog/big-break/#lets-hope-things-get-better---heres-a-short-video-of-diesel)!
- create a bucketlist template for a helpful collaborative project I have in mind -> [done](/bucketlist)
- create a codeberg repo for nifty-ideas / shower thoughts -> [here you go](/ideas)
- setup a PGP key & learn that stuff -> done! you can send me [encrypted](/email) emails now \o/
- learn kdenlive -> not really: I didn't explore all the features yet.
- make memes on reddit -> not reddit tho, I [posted on Telegram](https://tx.me/s/privacymemes) instead
- These were some for starters --- This year I focussed on [academics](/blog/big-break).
  I didn't really know what was in store, until July when I officially collected my transfer-certificate from school: JEE prep is going great so far!

## I graduated 10th grade üë®‚Äçüéì

Due to the pandemic, we technically didn't have our board exams. The ICSE board
cooked up some formula & decided to weigh our 9th grade marks, the pre-boards,
& project marks to calculate our score, reasonable; but nothing to brag about.
I wish I had a real offline exam tho. But anyway --- like the boomer's say: time
& tide waits for none, life moves on, 12th grade will be more important.

So I decided to prep for JEE & focus on getting into college. For the rest of
2021 I was engaged in JEE oriented assignments, course work, et. al. I
generally have tests every week, joined a coaching (tutoring) center ~ towards
that long term goal I set out, outlined [here](/blog/big-break). The JEE exam.
Got a lot of things done, I particularly loved Physics, the many counter-intuitive problems.
Look up problems under 'surface tension & bubbles when they coalesce' for fun.
[H.C. Verma's Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources?isbn=8177091875) illustrates
these concepts pretty well.

## Holiday mood üå¥

## Media, Music, DRM & other tech stuff

I used to use Spotify, Discord, YouTube extensively, do I regret it? -
apparently yeah. Not worth my time anymore. I want stuff to be completely
offline. Not consooom 24/7. I deleted my Spotify & Discord accounts back in
January. Switched to playing music locally using [Lollypop](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Lollypop).
Probably learn to produce music too?

I blocked ``youtube.com`` using [NextDNS](https://polarhive.net/videos/notes/nextdns-dns-firewall-for-privacy).
I suggest using [Piped](https://piped.video) when you need to stream, it can proxy
videos for you. You don't really miss out, in the long run [you are what you
eat](/blog/you-are-what-you-eat/). Our attention spans have reduced.
7 [seconds](https://www.andrewvorster.com/7-seconds/) or so is what advertisers
target now. Do you use TikTok? Reels? YoutTube Shorts? I don't. Try quitting those services, you won't miss
much. Cold Turkey 2022?: if you feel inspired by what I did last year.

## I switched to a tiling WM

So I apparently quit using KDE Plasma on my Laptop.

![terminal](terminal.png "But free RAM is wasted RAM!? I don't mind lol")

## üçö ricin'

There's nothing wrong with KDE Plasma. But your know *nix users can never settle. So [this
post](/blog/how-i-do-my-computing/) needs an update. I'm using Sway; an i3 like WM
which is running on Wayland. Here are the [dotfiles](/dots).

## minimalism

I quite like this new setup. My battery life has improved a tiny bit. No fancy
graphics or blur. I've riced my desktop. I'm proud of my RAM usage lol 296 MB
only.

## [phone?](phones-make-me-counter-productive)

I'm still using my trusty Redmi Note 5.

!["me holding my phone"](/blog/phones-make-me-counter-productive/hand.webp)

## no signs of degradation yet

I hope I can crank-another 125 charge cycles [again](/blog/phones-make-me-counter-productive)

!["battery life graph"](/blog/phones-make-me-counter-productive/battery.webp)

### ü§î

As crazy as it sounds, I wanted to build a new browser [engine](/crust).
Just for fun, look at Gecko, Blink, WebKit, Servo source code & make
something that can work with CSS & basic JS. An extreme, long term goal
in the years to come. I wanna make something interesting, not some
boring, bloated electron app.

# 2022?

## So what's in store for the next year?

There's definitely more to study: after August, the revision-phase starts, we
brush through our entire JEE syllabus, then write mock-tests. Phew. üòÖ and August?
The month I turn 18! I'll tick more-things off my [/bucketlist](/bucketlist).

- Probably learn to drive
- Vote? 2024 or State elections
- Post a couple of videos
- Post more photos to [pixelfed](/photos) this year
- Continue taking photos a week
- Network ü§ù
- Wake up at 5 every day
- Redesign my room
- A [programming language](https://codeberg.org/polarhive/ideas/src/branch/main/lang.md) for humans
- document observations & experiments using that language
- work on a secret project ~ 'a hack'

### As always: feel free to network or simply say [hi üëã](/contact)

I'll respond when I'm free, it's always fun helping out other people wandering
the interwebs.
